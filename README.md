# Testing Practice

My first tests in JavaScript using Jest.

This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) curriculum.

## Functions 

- ``capitalize``: function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

- ``reverseString``: function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

- ``calculator``: object that contains functions for the basic operations (add, subtract, divide, and multiply). Each of these functions take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

- ``caesarCipher``: function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.

- ``analyzeArray``: function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with average, min, max, and length as properties.
